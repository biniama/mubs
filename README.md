### MUBS is a simple blog system that allows users to manage their own blog. ### 

It is developed using **Grails** - a java based web application developement framework. 
The application uses **MySql** database to persist data.
The IDE (Integrated Development Environment) used is **IntelliJ**.

**Grails** is a full stack framework and attempts to solve as many pieces of the web development puzzle through the core technology and its associated plugins. Included out the box are things like:
*      An easy to use Object Relational Mapping (ORM) layer built on Hibernate
* 	An expressive view technology called Groovy Server Pages (GSP)
* 	A controller layer built on Spring MVC
* 	A command line scripting environment built on the Groovy-powered Gant
* 	An embedded Tomcat container which is configured for on the fly reloading
* 	Dependency injection with the inbuilt Spring container
* 	Support for internationalization (i18n) built on Spring's core MessageSource concept
* 	A transactional service layer built on Spring's transaction abstraction.

The source code of the application can be found from here. 
		https://<username>@bitbucket.org/biniama/mubs.git
It can be checked out using **GIT** distributed version control system.

The public can access the web app from
    http://www.localhost:8080/mubs
	
There are three main models (domain classes) and others which are generated by Spring Security Core Plugin.

**Main models**

	User			- generated by Spring Security Core Plugin but updated to incorporate basic user data

	*Rules (Cardinality in Database):*
	* One User has one Blog.
	* One Blog has many BlogEntries.
	
	** Detail of the model fields can be found in the source code with inline comment.
